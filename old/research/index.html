<p><h2>Latent Class Models for Verbal Autopsy Data </h2>
 <p>The aim of this project is to estimate individual and population level causes of death in areas where health services are limited and often inaccessible. In such cases, doctors and researchers often must rely on ”verbal autopsy” questionnaires to assign a cause of death.
By treating the cause of death as a latent variable, we plan to use a combination of symptom and demographic data to develop a tool that will assist physicians and other stakeholders in cause of death assignment.

<h2>Nested Partially Latent Class Model with Regression Components </h2> 
<p>In many settings, researchers would like to evaluate the influence of certain covariates on latent class probabilities. For example, how does seasonality affect the probability of being infected by a certain pathogen? The objective of this project was to extend the framework of <a href=https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/18/2/200/2555349> nested partially latent class models</a> to allow covariates to influence class probabilities. 
  You can find our paper <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08436> here</a> and a poster that I presented at the 2019 Michigan Data Science Symposium <a href=https://zhenkewu.com/assets/pdfs/posters/MIDAS_2019_poster.pdf>here</a>.
