<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I am a second year Biostatistics Ph.D Student at the University of Michigan. I am passionate about studying scientific and health related problems within the context of social, political, environmental, and other factors, so that we can develop new ways to model and evaluate these complex systems.  
I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Washington in Economics, Mathematics, and a minor in International Studies.
<p> Currently, I am working on projects related to latent variable models with <a href=https://zhenkewu.com/>Dr. Zhenke Wu</a>. 
<p>In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and trying out (and/or veganizing) new recipes. 
<p>Below are some links that I highly recommend, and hope you will enjoy!
